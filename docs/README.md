## Documentation Structure and Purpose

Each documentation file has a specific focus and purpose:

### mental_model.md
This document provides a high-level understanding of the system's purpose, organization, and architecture. It's designed to help developers and stakeholders understand the "why" behind design decisions and how different parts of the system fit together conceptually.

### implementation_details.md
This document details the specific technical implementations, data models, and code organization. It serves as a reference for developers working on the code and explains the reasoning behind implementation choices.

### gotchas.md
This document catalogs known issues, edge cases, limitations, and their workarounds. It's a living document that should be updated whenever new quirks or solutions are discovered.

### quick_reference.md
This document provides a concise reference for common parameters, configurations, commands, and APIs. It's designed for quick lookup during development and operation.

## Documentation Maintenance

When making changes to the codebase, follow these guidelines:

1. Update relevant documentation immediately after code changes
2. Add examples, explanations, and references for all new or updated functionality
3. Document newly discovered quirks or limitations in `gotchas.md`
4. Keep all documentation in sync with the codebase
5. Consider documentation as part of the development process, not an afterthought
